title: Do I need prior experience? What prior experience did you have?
---

Absolutely not - you do **not** need prior experience to participate in GCI. The contest is designed for students of all skill levels, from beginners to experts. Of course though, having some knowledge about coding or in other areas is certainly helpful. There is no need to worry if you do not know how to program - you can either learn as you go, or you can take on the non-coding tasks (documentation, outreach, quality assurance, and graphic design).

In my case, this was my first year with GCI, having heard of it through [Google's Open Source Blog](https://opensource.googleblog.com). Prior to the start of the contest, I had dabbled briefly in Git, never contributed to a repository as large as coala, nor have I ever worked with continuous integration or unit testing. I walked into GCI armed only with a sense of determination and some decent knowledge of Python.

For 50 days, I pored over documentation, traced strangers' code, and asked questions to mentors. And at the end of those 50 days, I have traveled much farther than I initially expected. I now have experience in:

    - Python unit testing and mock
    - Advanced Git skills
    - Continuous integration (looking at you, Travis)
    - Templating and syncing
    - Code styling standards
    - coala, of course
    - ... and much, much more!

It seems to me that all that is needed to succeed is the right mindset.

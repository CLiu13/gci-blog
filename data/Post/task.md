title: What exactly is a task? Which ones did you complete, and how?
---

A task is an assignment that you have to complete, and there are 5 categories of them: coding, documentation, outreach, quality assurance, and graphic design. You can view examples of tasks from previous years [here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/resources/example-tasks).

The first step is to pick a task from the list on the GCI dashboard. If you are new to GCI, then start with a beginner or low task. On the other hand, if you have already completed a few tasks and have some experience under your belt, go for a challenge by selecting a medium or even high task. It certainly pays off to do some brief research on a task before choosing it, especially since you can only claim one task at a time.

Depending on the difficulty of the task (beginner, low, medium, or high) that you have claimed, you will then have between 3 to 5 days to complete it. This is quite generous, considering that most tasks do not take up nearly as much time as given. However, if you do need more time, don't be afraid to ask for an extension - if you have a valid reason and explain this to your mentor, they will likely grant you an extra day or two. And as always, if you are struggling on a task, take a break and ask a mentor for help! They will be more than happy to guide you.

Aside from just achieving the objective specified by a task, you must also receive approval from a mentor in order to fully complete a task and receive credit. Often times, you will have to go back and make some minor adjustments after a mentor has reviewed your task - this is a normal part of the process, so don't get frustrated. If you happen to disagree with a mentor's suggestions, then politely discuss it with them via the organization's preferred communication method.

After all of that, hooray! You have completed a task! Now, the cycle starts over again. It gets tremendously easier each time you go through this process, and sooner than you know it, you will have become a pro at completing GCI tasks.

As of the time of this writing, I have completed 20 tasks in the coala organization (and GCI as a whole, since I have been with coala since the start). Out of the 20, 1 was at the beginner level, 7 were low-difficulty, 10 were medium-difficulty, and 2 were high-difficulty. From the experience gained while doing these tasks, I have gathered a few tips that could help you out with your own tasks:

- **If your organization has a set of commit guidelines, make sure to follow it!** For instance, you can find coala's commit guidelines [here](https://api.coala.io/en/latest/Developers/Writing_Good_Commits.html).

- **If your organization has a set of style guidelines, also follow that!** For instance, many Python repositories, including coala, conform to the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

- **If a repository that you are working on uses continuous integration (such as [Travis](https://travis-ci.com)), make sure that your changes pass all the tests!** If not, go back and make some quick edits - you mentor will likely not approve the task until that is fixed.

- **Create a schedule for completing tasks!** As a high-school student, I am consumed by schoolwork and other extracurriculars, yet I was always able to dedicate at least an hour (usually a few hours) to GCI daily. By doing so, you ensure that you will meet deadlines, stay up-to-date with new changes, and develop a good work ethic.

- **Don't be afraid to claim a task that may be more challenging for you - after all, that is how you learn something new!** However, to avoid biting off more than you can chew, spend some time researching a task before claiming it, so at the very least you have an idea of what you are walking into.

- **When in doubt, ask a mentor!** They are there to help you out. Just make sure that you always remain polite and courteous when talking with them, since they are kindly volunteering their own free time to mentor GCI students.

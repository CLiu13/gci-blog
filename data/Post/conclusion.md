title: Final Thoughts and Conclusion
---

50 days, nearly 2 months - wow! I still cannot believe that GCI is ending, yet here we are.

First and foremost, I would like to again thank all the coala mentors for the work that they put into this, making the contest more enjoyable for us students. I definitely could not have done it without you.

Secondly, if you are reading this blog as a potential GCI student, [register](https://codein.withgoogle.com) for it now! It may sound like just work at first, but it truly is more than just that - the experience provided by GCI is invaluable. You learn so much while being able to interact with such a vibrant community of developers from all over the world, most of whom are your age.

Third, I would also like to thank the entire [coala organization](https://github.com/coala) for making GCI awesome. I knew that there was always going to be someone willing to lend a hand, whether they were a fellow student or a mentor. The pace of the contest was also perfect at coala - I never felt rushed or pressured, and mentors were understanding of our busy lives as high-schoolers.

You can count on seeing me next year, maybe even as a mentor! And, if time allows me to, I will continue contributing to coala throughout the year, whenever possible.

As I am typing this, there is just a few hours before the claiming deadline for GCI. What a journey! As clich√©d as it is to say this, time really does fly when you have fun.

Last words are always hard... so instead, I will end my blog with a haiku or two :)

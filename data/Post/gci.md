title: What is Google Code-in?
---

[Google Code-in](https://codein.withgoogle.com) (GCI) is, according to Google, "a contest to introduce pre-university students to open source software development." In other words, GCI is a competition where students contribute to organizations by completing tasks for publicly available projects.

Although it does include the word "code" in its name, GCI is not exclusive to programmers only - don't hesistate to join if you haven't coded before! There are countless tasks that involve graphic design, documentation, outreach, quality assurance, and of course, coding.

The idea of working for an organization while competing with others may sound daunting at first, but don't worry. GCI is designed so that anyone can participate and succeed, as long as you have the right mindset. In fact, GCI is often the first time when students interact with [open source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) (OSS), so you are not behind at all if you don't know what OSS even means.

As mentioned before, GCI consists of several OSS organizations that offer tasks for students to complete. Past examples of organizations have included Ubuntu, Wikimedia, Fedora, and other names that you may recognize. You can find the current list of organizations [here](https://codein.withgoogle.com/organizations). In my case, I chose to work on an organization called [coala](https://codein.withgoogle.com/organizations/coala/). There is no advantage/disadvantage in picking a certain organization - I decided on coala simply because I thought that they had the cutest [logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coala_Logo.svg#/media/File:Coala_Logo.svg).

Within each organization, there are groups of mentors that are ready and eager to help you out. For instance, in coala, there were over 20 registered mentors, with several that were available on a daily basis. Depending on the organization, you may communicate with these mentors and other students via online chatrooms (such as Zulip, which is what coala used), forums, IRC, etc. Always make sure to follow proper [etiquette](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gci/resources/etiquette) when talking with others.

Interested yet? GCI typically runs during the later half of the year (in 2018, it was from October 23 to December 12), so if the timing is right, you can register now for GCI by going [here](https://codein.withgoogle.com) and clicking "Student Registration" - you will need to verify your age as a student, and your parent will need to submit a parental consent form. After that, welcome to GCI! The fun is just getting started.

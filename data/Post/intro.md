Hello world! I am [CLiu13](https://github.com/CLiu13), a high-school student and participant in the 2018 Google Code-in competition. In this blog, you can learn more about Google Code-in from posts that describe my first-hand experiences. You can also check out the detailed lists of the mentors, repos, and tasks that I have worked with/on throughout the competition.
